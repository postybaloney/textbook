# ## Exercises ##

# **1.** A Prob 140 student comes to lecture at a time that is uniformly distributed between 5:09 and 5:14. Independently of the student, the professor begins the lecture at a time that is uniformly distributed between 5:10 and 5:12. What is the chance that the lecture has already begun when the student arrives?

# **2.** For some constant $c$ let $X$ and $Y$ have a joint density given by
# 
# $$f(x, y) ~ = ~ 
# \begin{cases}
# c(x - y), ~~ 0 < y < x < 1 \\
# 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \text{otherwise.}
# \end{cases}$$
# 
# (a) Draw the region over which $f$ is positive.
# 
# (b) Find $c$.
# 
# (c) Find $P(X > Y + 0.4)$. Before you calculate, shade the event on the
# diagram you drew in (a).
# 
# (d) Find the density of $X$.
# 
# (e) Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?
# 
# (f) Find $E(XY)$.

# **3.** Let $X$ and $Y$ have joint density $f$ given by
# 
# $$f(x, y) ~ = ~ 
# \begin{cases}
# \frac{40}{243}x(3-x)(x-y), ~~~~ 0 < y < x < 3 \\
# 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \text{otherwise.}
# \end{cases}$$
# 
# Write the each of the following in terms of $f$ but do not simplify the
# expression. Integrals should not include regions where $f(x, y) = 0$.
# 
# (a) $P(Y > 1)$
# 
# (b) the conditional density of $X$ given $Y = 1$ (please be clear about
# the values on which the density is positive)
# 
# (c) $E(e^{XY})$

# **4.** The joint density of $X$ and $Y$ is
# 
# $$f(x, y) ~ = ~
# \begin{cases}
# 24xy, ~~~ x, y > 0  \text{ and } 0 < x+y < 1 \\
# 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \text{otherwise.}
# \end{cases}$$
# 
# (a) Find the density of $X$. Recognize this as one of the famous ones and state its name and parameters.
# 
# (b) Without further calculation, find the density of $Y$ and justify your answer.
# 
# (c) Are $X$ and $Y$ independent? Why or why not?
# 
# (d) Find the conditional density of $X$ given $Y = 0.75$. As always, start with the possible values.
# 
# (e) Find $P(X > 0.2 \mid Y = 0.75)$.
# 
# (f) Find $E(X \mid Y = 0.75)$.

# **5.** Let $U_i$, $1 \le i \le 20$ be i.i.d. uniform $(0, 1)$ variables, and let $U_{(k)}$ be the $k$th order statistic.
# 
# (a) What is the density of $U_{(7)}$?
# 
# (b) Without integrating the density, find the cdf of $U_{(7)}$.
# 
# [Draw a line representing the unit interval and put down crosses representing the variables. For $U_{(7)}$ to be less than $x$, how must you distribute the crosses?]
# 
# (c) Find the joint density of $U_{(7)}$ and $U_{(12)}$.

# **6.** A random variable $X$ has the beta $(2, 2)$ density. Given $X = x$, the conditional distribution of the random variable $Y$ is uniform on the interval $(-x, x)$.
# 
# (a) Find $P(Y < 0.2 \mid X = 0.6)$.
# 
# (b) Find $E(Y)$.
# 
# (c) Find the joint density of $X$ and $Y$. Remember to specify the
# region where it is positive.
# 
# (d) Find $P(X < 0.3, \vert Y \vert < 0.3X)$.

# **7.** Let $X$ and $Y$ be i.i.d. with a joint density.
# 
# (a) Find $P(Y > X)$.
# 
# (b) Find $P(\vert Y \vert > \vert X \vert)$.
# 
# (c) If $X$ and $Y$ are i.i.d. standard normal, find $P(Y > \vert X \vert)$.

# **8.** Two points are placed independently and uniformly at random on the unit interval. This creates three segments of the interval. What is the chance that the three segments can form a triangle?
# 
# [To find probabilities of events determined by two independent uniform $(0,1)$ random variables, itâ€™s a good idea to draw the unit square.]

# **9.** Let $X$ have the beta $(r, s)$ density. Find $Var(X)$. You can assume $r$ and $s$ are integers.
