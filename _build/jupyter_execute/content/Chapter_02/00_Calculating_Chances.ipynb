    "Once you start working with probabilities, you quickly realize that the assumption of all possible outcomes being equally likely isn't always reasonable. For example, if you think a coin is biased then you won't want to assume that it lands heads with the same chance as tails. \n",

    "To deal with settings in which some outcomes have a higher chance than others, a more general theory is needed. In the 1930's, the Russian mathematician [Andrey Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov) (1903-1987) formulated some ground rules, known as *axioms*, that covered a rich array of settings and became the foundation of modern probability theory.\n",

The first two axioms just set the scale of measurement: they define probabilites to be numbers between 0 and 1.\n",
