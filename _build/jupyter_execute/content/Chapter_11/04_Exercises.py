# **1.** Let $X_0, X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a Markov chain with time-homoegeneous transition probabilities. Suppose that for a fixed state $i$, the transition probability $P(i, i)$ is positive. In other words, the chain has positive probability of staying put at this state $i$.
# 
# Suppose the chain starts at this state $i$. That is, suppose you are given $X_0 = i$. Let $T$ be the first time the chain leaves $i$. Formally, $T = \min\{n \ge 1: X_n \ne i\}$.
# 
# Find the distribution of $T$. Recognize it as one of the famous ones and provide its name and parameters.

# **2.** Let $X_0, X_1, \ldots$ be an irreducible, aperiodic Markov Chain on a finite state space $S$. Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the transition matrix of the chain. Let $\lambda$ be the initial distribution of the chain. That is, let $\lambda$ be a vector containing the distribution of $X_0$.
# 
# (a) Find the distribution of $X_n$ in terms of $\lambda$, $\mathbb{P}$, and $n$.
# 
# (b) What happens to the distribution of $X_n$ as $n \to \infty$? Prove your answer.

# **3.** Fix $p \in (0, 1)$ and a positive integer $N$, and let $q = 1-p$. Consider the Markov Chain with transition probabilities given by:
# 
# - $P(0, 1) ~ = ~ p$ and $P(0, 0) = q$.
# - $P(N, N) = p$ and $P(N, N-1) = q$.
# - For $1 \le i \le N-1$, $P(i, i+1) ~ = ~ p$ and $P(i, i-1) = q$
# 
# (a) Is there a probability distribution that satisfies the detailed balance equations? 
# 
# (b) Find the stationary distribution of the chain.

# **4.** Every transition matrix is a *stochastic matrix* because all its rows sum to 1. If all the columns also sum to 1, the matrix is called *doubly stochastic*.
# 
# (a) Suppose an irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain on a finite state space has a doubly stochastic transition matrix. Show that the stationary distribution is uniform on the state space.
# 
# [Use uniqueness and the balance equations.]
# 
# (b) For $n \ge 1$, let $S_n$ be the total number of spots on $n$ rolls of a die. For large $n$, approximately what is the probability that $S_n$ is a multiple of 7? [Think about remainders and use Part **a**.]

# **5.** I don’t know why this problem has become a classic. But versions of it appear in many texts and exercise sets with diverse people getting wet.
# 
# It’s essentially an exercise in setting up a useful chain based on which you can easily find the desired proportion.
# 
# A professor has two umbrellas, each of which could either be in her office or in her car. The professor walks from her car to her office; she also walks from her office to her car. Assume that on each of these walks:
# 
# - It rains with probability 0.7, independently of all other walks.
# - If it is not raining, the professor ignores the umbrellas.
# - If it is raining, she uses an umbrella if there is one, and gets wet if there isn’t.
# 
# In the long run, what is the expected proportion of walks on which the professor gets wet?

# **Selections from Konstantopoulos**
# 
# Emeritus Prof. David Aldous' former student Takis Konstantopoulos created a great [resource](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/150/takis_exercises.pdf) of exercises on Markov Chains. Selected problems are listed below. 
# 
# The exercises are numerous. Here are some to try. Resist the impulse to read the answers before you try the exercises yourself. 
# 
# - 7 ('topological properties' means whether it is irreducible and what its period is; for the irreducible aperiodic ones, find the long run proportion of time spent at each state)
# - 16 
# 
# - 21
# 
# - 25
# 
# - 27 (you can do this one without calculation)
# 
# - 36
