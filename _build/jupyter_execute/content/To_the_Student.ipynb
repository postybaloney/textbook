    "Data science is about making conclusions based on large amounts of data of diverse forms. But most data sets, no matter how large or complex, provide only incomplete information about the questions that interest us. When data scientists make conclusions, they often have to account for uncertainty.\n",

    "Probability theory studies the nature of randomness and gives us ways to quantify uncertainty. For example, it helps explain a phenomenon familiar to you from Data 8: that large random samples can hold rich stores of information about unknown quantities. Data scientists can use this to make valid conclusions about those unknowns, in spite of the uncertainties inherent in sampling.\n",
