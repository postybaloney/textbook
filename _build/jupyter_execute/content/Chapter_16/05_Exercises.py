# ## Exercises ##

# **1.** Let $X$ have density $f_X(x) = 2x$ for $0 < x < 1$. Find the density of
# 
# (a) $5X - 3$
# 
# (b) $4X^3$
# 
# (c) $X/(1+X)$

# **2.** Let $X$ have density $f(x) = 2x^{-3}e^{-x^{-2}}$ on the positive real numbers. Find the density of $X^4$.

# **3.** For a fixed $\alpha > 0$ let $X$ have the Pareto density given by
# 
# $$f(x) ~ = ~ \frac{\alpha}{x^{\alpha+1}}, ~~ x > 1$$
# 
# Find the density of $\log(X)$. Recognize this as one of the famous ones and provide its name and parameters.

# **4.** Let $X$ be a random variable. Find the density of $X^2$ if $X$ has the
# uniform distribution on $(-1, 2)$.

# **5.** Let $U$ have the uniform $(0, 1)$ distribution. For $\lambda > 0$, find a function of $U$ that has the exponential $(\lambda)$ distribution.

# **6.** Let $Z$ be standard normal.
# 
# (a) Use the change of variable formula to find the density of $1/Z$. Why do you not have to worry about the event $Z = 0$?
# 
# (b) A student who doesn’t like the change of variable formula decides to first find the cdf of $1/Z$ and then differentiate it to get the density. That’s a fine plan. The student starts out by writing $P(1/Z < x) = P(1/x < Z)$ and immediately the course staff say, “Are you sure?” What is the problem with what the student wrote?
# 
# (c) For all $x$, find $P(1/Z < x)$.
# 
# (d) Check by differentiation that your answer to (c) is consistent with your answer to (a).

# **7.** Let the random variable $X$ have cdf $F$ and let the random variable $Y$ have cdf $G$. You can assume that both $F$ and $G$ are continuous and increasing.
# 
# (a) Find a function $h$ such that the random variable $h(X)$ has the uniform $(0, 1)$ distribution.
# 
# (b) Use Part (a) to find a function $g$ such that the random variable $g(X)$ has the same distribution as $Y$.
